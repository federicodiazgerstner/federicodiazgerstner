Passionate about technology and always looking forward in improving as a Software Developer, I've learned Front-End Development @ CourseIT, where I used React, Javascript, Material UI, HTML & CSS as the core technologies. I also have experience in Node.js, MongoDB, SQL Server.
  
I'm also taking a undergraduate degree @ UADE, where I've learnt how to build robust apps using technologies such as React.js, Node.js, MongoDB, React Native.
